# Network-Monitoring-System-with-Raspberry-Pi

**INTRODUCTION**
Snort is an open source-based tool. It is a Network Monitoring system. It uses rule-based language where we can write our own rules and design the system. Rules such as alert, log, drop the connection, block etc. It has three different modes packet sniffer, packet logger and NIPDS. In this project, we will cover the custom rules about SSH, FTP, Ping traffic, Telnet and block or reject Ip traffic. It can behave as IDS and IPS.

As shown in figure 1, the snort is a open source tool used on raspberry pi which is capable of monitoring networks. If there is any suspicious activity going on, then it is going to alert and display the alert in console. In this way it protects the trusted network from malicious attackers.
